        We,too , have included the technology stream due to the kind request of
        the students and also the Provincial Director of Education in 2016. But
        now, because of the demands, we have handed over the responsibilities of
        the technology stream to the very own faculty of technology students,
        the University of Jaffna, and we just guide them for their own
        betterment.
